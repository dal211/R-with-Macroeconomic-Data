# R-with-Macroeconomic-Data
Analyzing growth rates and running regressions on Penn World Table data (examples from a problem set in Macro theory)

(a)	Descriptive Statistics

-	GDP per worker in 1985 and 2005, by country
-	Average Savings Rate from 1985 to 2005 by Country
-	Average Growth Rate of the Labor Force (n) from 1985 to 2005 by Country. 
- Average Growth Rate of GDP per worker from 1985 to 2005, gY/L. 
-	Number of Countries
-	Mean of log(Y/L1985) across all countries at t=1985
-	Mean of log(Y/L2005) across all countries at t=2005
-	Mean of “s” across all countries across all time in the data set
-	Mean of “n” (avg growth rate of labor force) across all countries across all time in the data set
-	Mean of gY/L (avg growth rate of GDP/worker) across all countries across all time in the data set 
-	Standard Deviation across countries for Y/L1985 and Y/L2005, respectively
-	Standard Deviation across countries & all time for “s”, the average savings rate
-	Standard Deviation across countries & all time for “n”, the average growth rate of the labor force
-	Standard Deviation across countries & all time for “gY/L”, the average growth rate of Y/L
